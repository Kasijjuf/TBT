<p>

TBT has built-in rendering for HTML pages containing our recordings: a
javascript class is provided to play them back live on homepages.

</p>

<p>

If you use the '-s html' option, an html file will be generated right
after the recording, you'll be then able to modify it (colors and
fonts) and then include it on your homepage. Along with the html file,
you should also include the tbt-typewriter.js file in the same
directory.

</p>

<p>

Everything in the generated html file can be moved and included in
bigger html pages, just make sure that you preserve intact all the
contents of the two &lt;script&gt; tags contained inside.
