Record and playback keystrokes with performance time emphasis.

This software permits to carry more information in written text by
saving the time delta beween keypresses and offering a way to
reproduce it.

This reference implementation is written in POSIX C, portable to most
platforms, GNU/Linux and Apple/OSX binaries are provided for download,
along the open source code.




::::: TRY IT (for text terminal beginners)

This is an Command Line Interface based program,
still the following instructions are user friendly:

- download from http://typewrotor.dyne.org

- unpack the tar.gz compressed archive

- open a Terminal

- type:
$ cd typewrotor
$ ./rectext.osx         # or ./rectext on GNU/Linux

= have phun with monkey typing and/or write your poetry

- press Ctrl-c (the Control key and the C key at same time)

- type:
$ ./playtext.osx        # or ./playtext on GNU/Linux

= read yourself again while typing





::::: COMPILE THE SOURCE

If you have a sane GNU/GCC compile environment[*] cd into the
sourcecode directory and type:

$ make

requirements are:

- C++ compiler
- C++ Standard Template Library
- S-Lang libraries (text console handling)

[*] GNU/Linux, BSD, Apple/OSX with XCode, CygWin with GCC




::::: VISIONS (so far)

- Mail client plugin (editor and viewer)
- ASCII Art, Poetry, Empathy
- TeleText (the next generation)
- Educational purposes



::::: PROTOCOL

In the .tbt format, text is saved with a timestamp for each letter:

         ________ _________ _____________
        |  uint  |  uint   |    uint     |
        |  64bit |  32bit  |    32bit    |
         -------- --------- -------------
....    |  char  | seconds | nanoseconds |    ....
         -------- --------- -------------
        |    Total: 128bit / 16 byte     |
         --------------------------------

However export to different formats is planned including generation of
web-ready code in HTML and Javascript, a daemon to provide timed input
thru a socket on the network (TCP/IP) and what not.

Input is captured from the console, but can be extended to intercept
any application using some h4x0r keylogging technique on different OS.
