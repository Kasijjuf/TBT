		Time Based Text    v0.6

  finger[k].start = j+2^{o+1} % (2^y);
  finger[k].interval = finger[k+1].flick - finger[k].flick;

Our objective here is to carry more information in written text.

The solution we propose is: record performance time in text and
vehicle it as additional information.

Saving and reproducing every single action during the composition of a
text let us vehicle emphasis in written communication.

As this simple concept, our implementation is also kept very
minimalistic while we welcome programmers to embed it in communication
applications.

The implementation is written in thread-safe POSIX C++ and can be
ported to most platforms.





::::: COMPILE THE SOURCE

If you have a sane GNU/GCC compile environment[*] cd into the
sourcecode directory and type:

$ make

requirements are:

- C++ compiler
- C++ Standard Template Library
- S-Lang libraries (text console handling)

[*] GNU/Linux, BSD, Apple/OSX with XCode, CygWin with GCC




::::: VISIONS (so far)

- Mail client plugin (editor and viewer)
- ASCII Art, Poetry, Empathy
- TeleText (the next generation)
- Educational purposes



::::: PROTOCOL

In the .tbt format, text is saved with a timestamp for each letter:

     _________ ___________ 
    |  u-int  |   u-int   |
    |  64bit  |   64bit   |    m-seconds = 1/1000 of a second
     --------- -----------
    |  char   | m-seconds |    char = ASCII or higher bit char code
     --------- -----------
    |    Total: 128bit    |
     ---------------------


However export to different formats is planned including generation of
web-ready code in HTML and Javascript, a daemon to provide timed input
thru a socket on the network (TCP/IP) and what not.

Input is captured from the console, but can be extended to intercept
any application using some h4x0r keylogging technique on different OS.
