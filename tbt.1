.SH NAME
tbt \- Time Based Text

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tbt [options] [file]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B tbt - Time Based Text

To vehicle more human-input information in written text.

Record performance time of written text and vehicle it as additional information: saving and reproducing every single action during the composition of a text let us vehicle emphasis in written communication.

As this simple concept, our implementation is also kept very minimalistic while we welcome programmers to embed it in communication applications, as in emails, blogs, visual poetry, slides and what not.

Beware this software is hacky, u need to love text. A manual page is provided and commandline formulas to be casted in a terminal.

This software is written in thread-safe POSIX C++ and can be ported to most platforms, it provides a real-time recorder for serial timed data, recording 64bit tuples key/msec with low-latency. Included are programs providing a text console interface for the user to experiment with keyboard.

A Web application written in PHP/MySQL and Ajax could be used to publish TBT written into the world wide web.

.SH PROTOCOL

In the .tbt format, text is saved with a timestamp for each letter:
   _________ ___________ 
  |  u-int  |   u-int   |
  |  64bit  |   64bit   |    m-seconds = 1/1000 of a second
   --------- -----------
  |  char   | m-seconds |    char = ASCII or higher bit char code
   --------- -----------
  |    Total: 128bit    |
   ---------------------

However export to different formats is planned including generation of web-ready code in HTML and Javascript, a daemon to provide timed input thru a socket on the network (TCP/IP) and what not.

Input is captured from the console, but can be extended to intercept any application using some h4x0r keylogging technique on different OS.

.SH COMMANDS

The main functionalities are exclusive (use one or the other):

.B
.IP "-r"
Record a Time Based Text
.B
.IP "-p"
Playback a Time Based Text
.B
.IP "-x \fI<format_name>\fR"
convert TBT file to format [ bin | html | ascii ]

The \fIbin\fR  mode will  store a  binary file you  can play  with the
playtext command.

The \fIhtml\fR  mode will  produce a simple  html page, in  which your
text    will    be    played.     The    distributed    script    file
\fItbt-typewriter.js\fR should be present in the same directory of the
html file. For further information  about the html mode please the the
README.html file.

The \fIascii\fR mode produces pure  ascii text file, one character per
line, with the information about the key pressed, and the timestamp.


.B
.IP "-h"
Display a help text and quit
.B
.IP "-v"
Display version and quit


.SH OPTIONS

The following switches are optional:

.B
.IP "-D \fI<number>\fR"
Set verbosity level, the default value is 1
.B
.IP "-c"
Use the S-Lang console interface
.B
.IP "-m"
mail composer - option alias: recmail
.B
.IP "-s \fI<format_name>\fR"
save format in [ bin | ascii | html ]. Default is bin (see -x command)

.B
.IP "-t \fI<timing mode>\fR"
method used to calculate time: [ posix | rtc ]. Default is posix.

So far a few methods are implemented, posix should be the most compatible,
rtc works only with Linux kernel and requires suid authority.



.SH EXAMPLES

.B
.IP "Howto record a tbt in binary format"

$ tbt -c -r mytext.tbt

.B
.IP "Howto play a tbt binary file"

$ tbt -c -p mytext.tbt

.B
.IP "Howto record a tbt in ascii mode"

$ tbt -c -r -s ascii mytext.txt

.B
.IP "Howto record a tbt in html mode"

$ tbt -c -r -s html mytext.html

.SH NOTES
The first integration provided for TBT is with Mutt \fIhttp://www.mutt.org\fR the Mail User Agent popular among text console users.
For further information please read the README.mutt file.
