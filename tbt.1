.SH NAME
TBT \- Time Based Text

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tbt [options] [file]

.SH DESCRIPTION

This software  is written to  vehicle more human-input  information in
written text.

We  record  performance  time  of  written  text  and  vehicle  it  as
additional  information: saving  and reproducing  every  single action
during the  composition of a text  let us vehicle  emphasis in written
communication.

As  this  simple  concept,   our  implementation  is  also  kept  very
minimalistic while we welcome programmers to embed it in communication
applications, as in emails, blogs, visual poetry, slides and what not.

Beware this software is minimalistic, you need to love text.

This manual will  follow documenting the TBT protocol  and usage, with
commandline  formulas to  be casted  in a  terminal.  Included  in the
sourcecode is also a website  written in PHP/MySQL/Ajax to publish TBT
written into the  world wide web, as well  a Python-GTK graphical user
interface.

.SH PROTOCOL

In the .tbt format, text is saved with a timestamp for each letter:
   _________ ___________ 
  |  u-int  |   u-int   |
  |  64bit  |   64bit   |    m-seconds = 1/1000 of a second
   --------- -----------
  |  char   | m-seconds |    char = ASCII or higher bit char code
   --------- -----------
  |    Total: 128bit    |
   ---------------------

This software is written in thread-safe POSIX C++ and can be ported to
most  platforms, it  provides a  real-time recorder  for  serial timed
data, recording  64bit tuples key/msec with  low-latency. Included are
programs providing a text console interface for the user to experiment
with keyboard.

Input is captured  from the console, but can  be extended to intercept
any application using some h4x0r keylogging technique on different OS.

Export  functionality  to  different  formats is  provided,  including
generation of web-ready code in HTML and Javascript.



.SH COMMANDS

The main functionalities are exclusive (use one or the other):

.B
.IP "-r"
Record a Time Based Text
.B
.IP "-p"
Playback a Time Based Text
.B
.IP "-x \fI<format_name>\fR"
convert TBT file to format [ bin | html | ascii ]

The \fIbin\fR  mode will  store a  binary file you  can play  with the
playtext command.

The \fIhtml\fR  mode will  produce a simple  html page, in  which your
text    will    be    played.     The    distributed    script    file
\fItbt-typewriter.js\fR should be present in the same directory of the
html file. For further information  about the html mode please the the
README.html file.

The \fIascii\fR mode produces pure  ascii text file, one character per
line, with the information about the key pressed, and the timestamp.


.B
.IP "-h"
Display a help text and quit
.B
.IP "-v"
Display version and quit


.SH OPTIONS

The following switches are optional:

.B
.IP "-D \fI<number>\fR"
Set verbosity level, the default value is 1
.B
.IP "-c"
Use the S-Lang console interface
.B
.IP "-m"
mail composer - option alias: recmail
.B
.IP "-s \fI<format_name>\fR"
save format in [ bin | ascii | html ]. Default is bin (see -x command)

.B
.IP "-t \fI<timing mode>\fR"
method used to calculate time: [ posix | rtc ]. Default is posix.

So far a few methods are implemented, posix should be the most compatible,
rtc works only with Linux kernel and requires suid authority.
