tbt-generator.html :
  standalone javascript/XHTML page to author tbt.

tbt.pl : 
  perl script to record tbt. 
 (Note: cursor movements are recorded, but terminal-text is overwritten 
  rather than shifted to right)

Both utilities write ASCII TBT files (identical to `../tbt -s doku`)
to be copy/pasted into a dokuwiki with tbt-plugin.
