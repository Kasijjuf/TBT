S-Lang widgets by Jaromil http://jaromil.dyne.org

This simple set of widgets are developed on top of the console library
S-Lang,  providing a  thread safe  implementation in  C++  for console
interface  elements as  popup boxes,  scroll  text boxes  and more  in
future: this is just a start and will hopefully grow in needs.

Main features that this library aims to achieve:
 - Low latency in operations (must react fast!)
 - Modularity and ease of use design
 - Complete thread safety

Most  notable  there is  the  abs_text_console  which  is an  abstract
implementation  for  a text  scrolling  console  (a  la readline,  but
different) that is  also ported to javascript for  TBT. Abstract means
this  text  console  handling  is completely  independent  from  other
libraries and  can be  included in other  software components  (as for
instance FreeJ for playback of TBT files in videos).
